            <p>The catch phrase for Coffee Cantata, “Coffee: Music in a Cup,” captures creator Margarets unpretentious approach to coffee connoisseurship. Her coffee reviews are cross-referenced by geographic origin and brew method. The precise details of the extraction process, like temperature and coffee-to-water ratio, are meticulously recorded so you can repeat the experience at home. Her tasting notes are vivid and delightful and they include serving thoughts, such as how the brew pairs with milk.</p>
